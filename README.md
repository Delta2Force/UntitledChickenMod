## What is this repo?

You might notice that this repo doesn't actually contain the source code for the mod. That is because the [Minecraft EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula) forbids me to publish the source code of this mod, since it would contain large amounts of Mojang-owned code.

> [...] you are not allowed to distribute the Game (or any part of it) to anyone else.

The german EULA elaborates on that:

> Der Begriff "Mod" bezeichnet ein Originalwerk von Ihnen oder jemand anderem, das keinen wesentlichen Teil unseres urheberrechtlich geschützten Codes oder Inhalts enthält.

Which translates to:

> The term "mod" stands for original work of you or somebody else, which doesn't contain an essential part of our copyrighted code or content.

Basically this means that if I would just release the unchanged source code, that would be an illegal copy of the game meaning that I could potentially get sued. If I make the source code unreadable, (obfuscate it) I'm safe and it counts as a mod, which they allow. The final reason why this repo exists is because I can automatically update the game. You can manually install the version from the releases, but I encourage the use of the [Installer / Updater.](https://github.com/Delta2Force/UntitledChickenMod-Installer)
